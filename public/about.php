                    <p>I’ve been called a change agent and “re-framer” because I curiously dismantle things to discover what they're made of and have a passion for making them better. To that end, I ask "why" and "what if" a lot because I'm driven to tell meaningful and authentic stories, while infusing delight along the way.</p>
                    <p>Underpinning my design skills, I notably bring strategic thinking and logic to the table with a desire to span both the creating and building gamut in my daily work.</p>
                    <p>I hold nearly twenty years of experience leading strategic design projects for CPG brands like Cheerios, Betty Crocker, and Yoplait, as well as guiding agency teams and direct reports.</p>
                    <p>I'm also excited to share that as of this past December, I tied the bow on my Master of Arts Degree in Graphic and Web Design from Minneapolis College of Art &amp; Design which has been something of a dream come true. </p>
